## 📂 Projects Overview

### Task 1: Email Spam Classification 📧
* **Objective:** Build a machine learning model to classify emails as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' (Ham).
* **Approach:** Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop-words removal, stemming). Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for feature extraction.
* **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes.
* **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy of **98.12%**.

### Task 2: MNIST Digit Recognition 🔢
* **Objective:** Develop a Deep Learning model to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.
* **Approach:** Performed image preprocessing and normalization. Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.
* **Algorithm:** CNN (TensorFlow / Keras).
* **Performance:** Achieved a test accuracy of **99.04%**.
